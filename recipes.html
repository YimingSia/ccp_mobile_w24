                <li>8 ounces (about 2 cups) elbow macaroni or any pasta of your choice</li>
                <li>1/4 cup unsalted butter</li>
                <li>1/4 cup all-purpose flour</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
                <li>1/4 teaspoon black pepper</li>
                <li>1/4 teaspoon mustard powder (optional, for extra flavor)</li>
                <li>2 1/2 cups milk</li>
                <li>2 cups shredded sharp cheddar cheese</li>
                <li>1/2 cup shredded mozzarella cheese (optional, for added creaminess)</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Instructions</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Cook the macaroni according to package instructions until al dente. Drain and set aside.</li>
                    <li>In a large saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the flour, salt, pepper, and mustard powder (if using). Stir constantly for about 2 minutes to create a roux.</li>
                    <li>Gradually whisk in the milk to the roux, making sure to eliminate any lumps. Continue to cook and whisk until the mixture thickens, usually about 5-7 minutes.</li>
                    <li>Reduce heat to low, and add the shredded cheddar cheese (and mozzarella if using). Stir until the cheese is completely melted and the sauce is smooth.</li>
                    <li>Add the cooked macaroni to the cheese sauce, stirring until the pasta is well coated.</li>
                    <li>Remove from heat and let it sit for a couple of minutes to allow the sauce to thicken slightly.</li>
                    <li>Serve the mac and cheese hot, and optionally, you can sprinkle extra cheese on top or add breadcrumbs for a crunchy topping.</li>
                </ul>
